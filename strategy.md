# Unitrack Business Strategy & Market Positioning

## 📊 Market Context

The fintech landscape is shifting from "transactional" tools (apps that just let you buy/sell) to "analytical" platforms (apps that help you understand what you own). High-net-worth individuals and tech-savvy investors find themselves managing assets across multiple platforms—Coinbase, Robinhood, Traditional Banks, and Realty.

**Unitrack fills the gap between these silos.**

## 🎯 The Modern Investor: Target Audience

Unitrack is designed for the **Self-Directed Global Investor**:

- **Tech-Savvy**: Comfortable with digital assets and expecting a premium, app-first experience.
- **Risk-Aware**: Interested in geographic diversification and "health scores" rather than just green/red charts.
- **Privacy-Conscious**: Prefers tools that use professional brokers (like Plaid) rather than manual credential entry.

## 🛡️ Value Proposition

1. **Uninterrupted Visibility**: Real-time syncing across all institutions via Plaid.
2. **Actionable Intelligence**: Not just $ amounts, but "Health Scores" and "Exposure Mapping."
3. **Institutional Grade Security**: Stateless architecture that prioritizes user data privacy.
4. **Premium Native UX**: A "No-Compromise" SwiftUI interface.
